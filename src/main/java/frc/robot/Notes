Further future:
        Offsets: Because the swerve Mods are set to zero when they are initialized, just read the position of each module After
        startup and use that as the offset after it is converted to degrees

    Retain Angle:
            HOW???
                Offseting gyro would lead to the Forward on the stick not being forward to the driver(IDEA OUT)
                Offset Angles and then remove offset once returning to normal?(NEEDS TESTING)

Questions:
    Why is 180 degrees added whenever the sticks are used?
        Is it defense or compensation for bad math? -- can't test yet

    I see that previous error and previous position are stored, but is anything done with these values?
        Are they necessary?
        They seem useful for some other function that the simple drive lacks
        TEST
    
Expectations:
    Once the offsets are properly defined, the robot will start with all wheels facing the same direction

    Forward will make the robot go Forward in relation to where the gyro is zeroed; backward, backward

    Left will make the robot strafe Left; right, right

    Turn will zero point turn the robot as if the robot is in tank configuration

Colton:

    Notice the use of static RobotMap in the SwerveSubsystem. Using that removes typing of RobotMap. over and over
    --It is a nice trick^

    Notice that the for-loops are used to iterate through the swerve modules. They are grouped into an array
    and handled one by one in less lines of code than it would take to do this individually
